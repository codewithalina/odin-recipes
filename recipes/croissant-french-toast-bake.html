    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This croissant French toast bake is perfect for company or a holiday brunchâ€”a grander version of breakfast pudding or baked French toast. </p>
    <p>Buttery croissants crisp on the top, and make it look as if you spent all day, but it is very easy to put together.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 large croissants (about 1 1/4 pounds), halved horizontally</li>
        <li>Confectioner's sugar, fresh berries, or maple syrup for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs, milk, heavy cream, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip each croissant half in the egg mixture until fully soaked.</li>
        <li>Arrange dipped croissants in the prepared baking dish, overlapping as needed. Pour any remaining egg mixture over croissants.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let stand 15 minutes before serving. Serve with desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
